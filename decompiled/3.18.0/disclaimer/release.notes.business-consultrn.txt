3.17.1 release (april 2019)
 . bug-fix      Fixes sd validation issue for the registerPerson operation:
                Dates defined with xsd type string in the ManagePerson webservice were defined as org.joda.time.DateTime in the
                business connector jaxb data model, causing xsd validation errors on the service provider side (= xsd validation error on the request).
                Fixed by updating the business connector jaxb model with the latest xsd version for the ManagePerson webservice. 
                This is linked to the this change in the ManagePerson cookbook v1.1:
                        - 1.1	10/07/2018	eHealth platform	Adaptation Birthdate value that could be incomplete in some case
